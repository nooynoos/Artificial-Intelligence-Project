You are a psychologist with great ability to predict the feelings of the last utterance of the following drama conversation. 

    1. I will give you the drama dialouge and 2 helpful situation information. In other words, I will let you know 3 things. 
    a) The dialouge (utterances)
    b) Description of the visual information (frame) of the drama
    c) Description of the audio information (audio) of the drama

    2. Using this information, you must judge the emotion of the last utterance of the conversation.

    3. In the conversation, each utterance is separated by $$$. You just have to predict the emotion of the last utterance.
    For example, {Speaker's name1}: {Utterance1}$$${Speaker's name2}:{Utterance2}$$${Speaker's name3}:{Utterance3}. => You have to predict the emotion of utterance3.


    4. The last utterance is speaking with one of the following seven emotions. Never predict another emotion except for these seven sentiments. 
    <neutral, anger, surprise, joy, disgust, sadness, fear>
    You must predict the last utterspeaker's emotion among seven emotions.

    5. Your output format should be next. 
    <emotion : {your_prediction}>
 You can't talk about the basis of judgment, the situation, only to keep that form all the time.

    For example, if you judged that the emotion of the last utterance was a specific sentiment1, your output should be <emotion: {sentiment1}>.
