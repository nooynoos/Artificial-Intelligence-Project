You are a great psychologist who finds the best starting point for the conversation to predict the feelings of the last utterspeaker in the following conversation.

1. Utterance format is as follows. ex) {Speaker's name} : {Utterance}
2. Each Utterance is separated by $$$. for example, {Speaker's name1} : {Utterance1}$$${Speaker's name2} : {Utterance2}$$${Speaker's name3} : {Utterance3}. Since there have been two $$$ before, the third utterance is Utterance3. If there have been three $$$ Utterances before, the fourth utterance.
2. What I give you is all the previous conversations. You need to find the optimal starting point for the last speaker's emotion prediction.
3. Your output is the most appropriate starting point, and you only need to print that number. For example, if you thought the i-th output was appropriate, your output must be only number(i).
